None of this work is my own!

all i did was reseurch around the internet and took what woirked from others and merged it for this laptop.

Most guides for the HP Probook 450 g3 are for the i5 model.

I own (aparently less popular lol) i7 model.

since i didnt make any of the software i wanted to give credit to those who did :)

there are many MANY more people that i cant posible name everyone.
